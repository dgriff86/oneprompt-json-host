Users can test the journey end-to-end: log an enquiry, convert to a member, interact with the platform, add workouts and classes, and book sessions seamlessly. All views are live, toggleable, and supported by local caching for persistent data.\n\nOne improvement to note: the site would benefit from mobile optimization, as access to the admin and member pages currently requires a horizontal screen orientation."
