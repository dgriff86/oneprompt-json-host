It should feel cutting-edge, a\n  little magical, and inspiring for creative technologists or curious\n  onlookers. Let your design system shine — bold layout, clean UI, and playful\n  touches are welcome.\n    \n    Use the following JSON as the data source:\n   \n  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgriff86/oneprompt-json-host/refs/heads/main/new1prompt.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgriff86/oneprompt-json-host/refs/heads/main/new1prompt.json)\n    \n    Each entry includes:\n    \n    * title\n    * url\n    * previewImage (optional)\n    * prompt\n    * createdAt (ISO date)\n    * notes (optional)\n    * tool (optional): the tool or platform used to build it (e.g.,\n  \"Lovable\")\n    * whatWorked (optional): short insight into what worked well in the\n  build\n    * whatDidntWork (optional): insight into challenges or what didn’t go to\n  plan\n    * nextSteps (optional): any future plans or learnings from this\n  prompt\n    \n    For each site card:\n    \n    * Show a screenshot preview using the `previewImage` URL if present.\n    * If missing, show a fallback visual block:\n    \n      * Soft, readable background color\n  with contrast from the text\n      * Bold site title centered\n      * Label like “Preview Not\n  Available” or clean default graphic\n    \n    Below the preview:\n    \n    * Display title (clickable, opens in new tab)\n    * Display createdAt formatted like \"May 12, 2025\"\n    * Add a dropdown toggle labeled \"View Prompt\" that expands to\n  show the full prompt inside a <pre> tag (preserves line breaks, dashes,\n  special characters)\n    * Ensure prompt content uses high contrast text (light on dark, or dark on\n  light depending on background)\n    * Include a \"Copy Prompt\" button inside the expanded area\n    * If any of the following exist, display them in a second toggle titled\n  “Build Notes”:\n    \n      * Tool used\n      * What worked well\n      * What didn’t work\n      * Next steps\n    * Only show `notes` if present, styled subtly\n    \n    Top of Page:\n    \n    * Title: “OnePromptSites”\n    * Subheading: “Exploring what’s possible with a single prompt.”\n    * Below the heading, include a short intro paragraph: \"OnePromptSites\n  is a growing archive of websites built using only a single AI prompt.
