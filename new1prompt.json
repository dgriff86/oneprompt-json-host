    "prompt": "Create a homepage for a project called \"OnePromptSite\" — a visually striking, modern directory that showcases websites created from a single AI prompt.\n\nThe purpose of this site is to demonstrate what is possible using AI to build entire sites from one prompt alone. It should feel cutting-edge, a little magical, and inspiring for creative technologists or curious onlookers. Let your design system shine — bold layout, clean UI, and playful touches are welcome.\n\nUse the following JSON as the data source:\n- - REDACTED - - \n\nEach entry includes:\n\n* title\n* url\n* previewImage (optional)\n* creator\n* prompt\n* createdAt (ISO date)\n* notes (optional)\n\nFor each site card:\n\n* Show a screenshot preview using the `previewImage` URL if present.\n* If missing, show a styled fallback visual block:\n\n* Include a clean, softly colored background\n* Bold title centered\n* Label like “Preview Not Available” or a clean SVG icon\n\nDisplay the following details:\n\n* Title (clickable, opens in new tab)\n* Creator name\n* Date created (formatted like \"May 12, 2025\")\n* A dropdown or toggle section labeled \"View Prompt\" that expands to reveal the full prompt\n\n* Prompt should be displayed using <pre> or similar block that preserves all special characters, line breaks, and dashes\n* Include a “Copy Prompt” button inside the expanded section\n* Only show `notes` if present\n\nDesign instructions:\n\n* Typography should be beautiful, readable, and modern\n* Responsive grid that feels good on both mobile and desktop\n* Let spacing, color, and hierarchy create flow\n* Don’t over-constrain layout — use modern patterns and nice touches like hover effects or animated expands\n\nAt the top of the page:\n\n* Site title: \"OnePromptSite\"\n* Tagline: \"Exploring what’s possible with a single prompt.\"\n\nFooter:\n\n* Centered message: “Built with AI · One prompt at a time”\n\nInclude:\n\n* Favicon\n* SEO metadata (title: OnePromptSite, description: A growing archive of websites built with one prompt alone.)\n\nAvoid including any contact forms or editing tools. This is a public-facing gallery powered entirely by the JSON feed.",

    "notes": "This is a solid foundation, a fully functional and interactive site flow: Landing Page → Admin Dashboard → Member Login. Users can test the journey end-to-end: log an enquiry, convert to a member, interact with the platform, add workouts and classes, and book sessions seamlessly. All views are live, toggleable, and supported by local caching for persistent data.\n\nOne improvement to note: the site would benefit from mobile optimization, as access to the admin and member pages currently requires a horizontal screen orientation.",
